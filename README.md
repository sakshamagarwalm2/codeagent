# codeagent

This project is an exploration into building an agentic system, akin to a cursor that understands its environment and can perform actions based on that understanding. The `todo_app` directory serves as a simple example to demonstrate the agent's capabilities.

## Project Structure

*   `todo_app/`: A basic todo application used as a testing ground for the agent.
*   `index.js`: The main script for the codeagent, where the agent's logic and interactions are defined.
*   `.env`: Contains environment variables, such as API keys, required for the agent to function.
*   `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sakshamagarwalm2/codeagent
    cd codeagent
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your necessary API keys (e.g., `GROQ_API_KEY`).

    ```env
    GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

4.  **Run the agent:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## How it Works

The codeagent uses a combination of:

*   **Language Model (LLM):** To understand natural language queries and determine the appropriate actions.
*   **Tools:** Functions that the agent can call to interact with the environment (e.g., reading files, running terminal commands, hypothetical weather info tool).
*   **Agentic Loop:** The agent operates in a loop, receiving a query, thinking about how to address it, taking actions if necessary, observing the results, and then either continuing the loop or providing an output.

## Example Usage (using todo_app)

While the agent can interact with various parts of the system through its tools, the `todo_app` provides a concrete example. You can ask the agent to perform actions related to the todo list (though the current `todo_app` example is very basic and doesn't have agent interaction built-in yet - this is a potential area for future development).

## Future Development

*   Implement more sophisticated tools for interacting with the file system and running more complex terminal commands.
*   Enhance the agent's ability to understand and modify code.
*   Integrate the agent with the `todo_app` example to allow direct manipulation of the todo list through natural language.
